    Welcome the user
    Ask for their name and store it as a string and call it "name"

    Create a 1D multi-type array with a length of 2 containing (name, age) called "playerData"

    Return {playerData}

    Create a 1D string array with a length of 3 containing 3 riddles called "riddles"
    Create a 1D string array with a length of 3 containing 3 answers called "answers"
    Create a 1D boolean array with a length of 3 containing (false, false, false) called "passes"

    Welcome the user

    Create a for loop that loops over the length of {riddles} as currentRiddle

        Create a boolean list called fails

        Create a for loop that loops over 3 times as i

            Print {riddles} at the index of {i}

            Ask for an answer and store it as an string and call it "answer"

            Else

                Print "Wrong"

                Check if {i} equals 2

                    Print the right answer

    Check if {passes} contains true

        Check if {passes} contains false
